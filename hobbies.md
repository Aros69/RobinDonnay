## Video games

- My favorite game series is Kingdom hearts
- I also like Borderlands and Fallout
- When I'm stressed, I listen my Fallout 4 Diamond City Radio [playlist on spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6fJARQytW295vVoUSUjk8I?si=zssq5g6TQySo2HoGUgalGQ). I don't know why but this help me
- Lara Croft my favorite character in video game history. She describes the evolution of the representation of women in the video game industry (from "nice to watch" to "powerfull and independant").

## Books

### SF books

- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy written by Douglas Adams
    - The three first books are awesome. I think the two other can be missed even if there are some good jokes in it. 
    - The other other books written by Douglas Adams : Dirk Gently is fun but not at the level of H2G2.
- Robot series written by Isaac Asimov
    - Every novel is perfect and even if it's an old series, it's an important series to understand AI and the consequences of it.

### Beer

I love stout and black beer but smoked beer are the best.  
I'm an amateur brewer who craft beer on his free-time.  
My first beer made with the [Brasserie Stéphanoise](https://www.labrasseriestephanoise.com/)  :
