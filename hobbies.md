### SF books

- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy written by Douglas Adams
    - The three first books are awesome. I think the two other can be missed even if there are some good jokes in it. 
    - The other other books written by Douglas Adams : Dirk Gently is fun but not at the level of H2G2.
- Robot series written by Isaac Asimov
    - Every novel is perfect and even if it's an old series, it's an important series to understand AI and the consequences of it.

I love stout and black beer but smoked beer are the best.  
I'm an amateur brewer who craft beer on his free-time.  
My first beer made with the [Brasserie Stéphanoise](https://www.labrasseriestephanoise.com/)  :
