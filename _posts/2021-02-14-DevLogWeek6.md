As I expected, my motivation is running low and I'm struggling to work on my projects as much ad I hoped.  
I 'm still reading the two research papers on FABRIK and I have trouble to really understand them.  
So instead of really doing nothing, I re-worked on my old FABRIK code in order to improve it and prepapre it for the next implementation parts (joint rotation and constraints).  
My goal is to be able to show clearly the difference of each implentation.  
  
This was not a great week but I will continue to work a bit each week as I promised.
