One of my resolution this year is to make more personnal dev projects. To complete this goal, I will do weekly devlog to keep track of my work.  
It's time to do some personal projects to improve myself in my passion, computer graphics and video games.  
I got my master degree and a job as tool developer at 8SEC.  
No more job search (for now) or school projects to do until 3 A.M because you have to present it tomorrow at 8 in the morning.    
As my boss said : "2020 was a warm up... 2021 is GAME TIME".  
I got two main project in my head at the moment, a VR Game and shaders. I also got side projects like another VR game, ps vita homebrew (I want to play nds game on it even if it's impossible), I also got a small robot that I want to improve in python and many other idea (AI, Robotics, ...).  
  
I don't know where all those things will bring me but "One is better than Zero". I don't care how far I'll go.   
It doesn"t matter if I can't finnish a project, I will win experience with it.   

Now let's talk about those projects a little bit.  
You can find my shader project on this [page](https://aros69.github.io/RobinDonnay/blog/ShadersEverywhere/) and on [github](https://github.com/Aros69/ShadersEverywhere).
