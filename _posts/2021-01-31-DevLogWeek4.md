As mention in the last devlog, I dedicated this week on research and learning.  
I work on two things. First, I start to search the best IK method for realtime in VR.  
As far as I searched, FABRIK is still the best method for me as it's fast, easy to understand and customize.  
I read that VR IK from FinalIK is also based on FABRIK so I guess it's the best choice at the moment.  
So I begin to read those two research paper : [First research paper about FABRIK](/RobinDonnay/pdf/FABRIK.pdf) and [Extension of FABRIK to add constraints](/RobinDonnay/pdf/Extending_FABRIK_with_Model_CÎ¿nstraints.pdf).  
I want to make things nicely so I will take my time to understand those papers as this part will highly increase the immersion in the game.
  

As this take some times and I wanted to have something to show this week I started another of my goals, do rendering and shaders on Unity.  
Thanks to [Cat Like Coding Course](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/), I can start coding quickly and already adapt one my last shader.

I still update the game on [itchio.io](https://arosthegame.itch.io/rock-it-for-me), as I promess. Here's the update video :

At the moment I feel more hyped about developing cool code features than doing the game.  
I guess that's because I'm not a game designer or a real game developer. I'm more attracted by engine, graphics or tool programming (a good thing as this is my work).
